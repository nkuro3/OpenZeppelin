Development Proceeds according to [Leran](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/)
- [x] developing-smart-contracts
- [x] deploying-and-interacting
- [x] writing-automated-tests
- [x] connecting-to-public-test-networks
- [x] upgrading-smart-contracts
- [ ] preparing-for-mainnet

### memo
#### deploying-and-interacting
skip below because `import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";` includes it.
```
// hardhat.config.js
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers');
```

In order to interact with the Box contract we deployed, weâ€™ll use an ethers contract instance.
[attach](https://docs.ethersz.io/v5/api/contract/contract/#Contract-attach)

#### writing-automated-tests
skip below as hardhat-toolbox includes it.
```
npm install --save-dev chai
```

Besides [performing-complex-assertions](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/writing-automated-tests#performing-complex-assertions), install below. 
For more details, please read [Truffle plugin](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/other-guides/truffle-testing#testing-with-web3.js-&-truffle).
```
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-truffle5 @nomiclabs/hardhat-web3 web3
```

add next code order to recognize bignumber.
```ts
import "chai-bn"; // add

// bignumber can be recognised by chai-bn
expect(await this.box.retrieve()).to.be.bignumber.equal(value);
```

test also can run by below.
```
npx hardhat test
```

#### connecting-to-public-test-networks
Insted of mnemonics, metamask account that is already created is used.
```ts
// accounts: { mnemonic: mnemonic },
accounts: [`${process.env.DEV_METAMASK_PRIVATE_KEY}`],
```

check deployed Box from [etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x375d1df94f2540f5a9b49e32c290571ba1430c7e)

#### upgrading-smart-contracts
Ownable is not upgradeable, so if contract is made as upgradeable, remove Ownale inheritance. (Box_Upgradable.sol)

**limitations-of-contract-upgrades**
- upgradeable contract cannot use constructor. Instead of it, `initializer` ensure that the function has initializer run only once in deploying.
- it also cannot change storage layout of that contract. So state variables can be changed, and olny add new variables.
- To learn more about this limitation, head over to the [Modifying Your Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#modifying-your-contracts) guide.
